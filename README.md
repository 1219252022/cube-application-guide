## Guide

### Stage-1

Use vue-cli to init a cube-template by the following command.

```shell
# Generate a cube project in current directory 
vue init cube-ui/template

# Or generate a cube project in the special sub directory
vue init cube-ui/template some-sub-directory
```

Then, you will see several ask to let you choose what kind of features you want.

As in this application, we need only two or three component of cube-ui, so we chose `importTyoe` as `partly`, the details is following.

```
$ vue init cube-ui/cube-template
